        <p>Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.</p>
        <p>However,  <a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html"> Flask </a> supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.</p>
